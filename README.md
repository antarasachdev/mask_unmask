# üò∑ Mask Detection using LandingAI

This project is a computer vision model for detecting whether people are wearing face masks in images. Built using [LandingAI](https://landing.ai/), it involves image annotation, training an object detection model, and deploying it for real-time testing.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Goal**: Detect faces with or without masks.
- **Platform Used**: LandingAI (No-code AI tool for vision projects)
- **Techniques**: Image annotation, object detection, confidence thresholding, real-time prediction
- **Model Output**: Bounding boxes around faces with class labels: `mask` or `no_mask`.
